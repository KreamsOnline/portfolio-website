                <h2>M7Education Redesign</h2>
                <p>This university bootcamp group project involved the redesign of a non-profit organization's website, M7 Education. We created a final prototype to showcase our work in this case study.</p>

      <h3><strong>Challenge:</strong></h3>
      <div class="separator"></div>
      <p>
        <strong>Outdated Website Design:</strong> The primary challenge in this case study revolved around the suboptimal user experience provided by M7Education's existing website. The website's outdated design, complex information structure, and lack of accessibility hindered its ability to effectively engage its target audience and achieve its mission of providing quality education to underserved communities.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Low Engagement and Accessibility Issues:</strong> Low user engagement and conversion rates, alongside the website's lack of mobile responsiveness and inconsistent branding, compounded these issues. This made it difficult for visitors to access educational resources and engage with the organization's initiatives.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Redesign Solution:</strong> The central aim of the case study was to address these challenges by delivering a well-informed and user-centered redesign solution that would ultimately result in a more engaging, accessible, and impactful online platform.

                <h3>Background of M7 Education</h3>
                <p>M7 Education was established with a clear vision of promoting educational equity and supporting students in state schools facing financial challenges. Understanding that schools with high pupil premium (above 30%) often struggle to provide enriching educational experiences, M7 Education aims to bridge this gap by funding impactful programs that benefit both students and teachers. Through financial support for educational experiences, the non-profit seeks to empower students to unlock their potential and equip teachers with the tools to create a transformative learning environment, ultimately contributing to a more equitable educational landscape.</p>

              <h3>Affinity Diagram Groups</h3>
              <p><strong>Group 1: Motivation and Website Influence</strong><br/>
                Interviewees across different roles, including teachers, parents, students, and community advocates, express a strong motivation to engage with non-profit organizations due to their commitment to educational opportunities. The website's role is pivotal in shaping their decision to support and engage. A user-friendly website that clearly communicates the organization's mission, impact, and funding application process significantly influences their motivation to contribute.<br/>
                <br/>
                <strong>Group 2: Website Engagement Frequency</strong><br/>
                The frequency of visiting non-profit websites varies among interviewees, with some visiting fairly frequently and others occasionally. The need to stay informed about funding opportunities and trip details drives their website visits. Different roles have distinct reasons for visiting, such as planning school trips, exploring partnership opportunities, or suggesting new ideas.<br/>
                <br/>
                <strong>Group 3: Information Value and Alignment</strong><br/>
                Interviewees emphasize the value of comprehensive and clear information on non-profit websites. They find it essential for websites to align with their interests and needs, whether it's providing educational details for teachers, aligning trips with children's interests for parents, or showcasing relevance to school curriculum for students. Effective communication of alignment significantly influences their support decisions.
              </p>
              <p><strong>Group 4: Positive User Experience</strong><br/>
                A positive user experience on non-profit websites has a profound impact on interviewees' engagement. Clear, step-by-step processes for applications and interactive features, such as proposing new trip ideas, contribute to their positive impressions. Such experiences enhance their confidence and trust in the organization, leading to continued participation and support.<br/>
                <br/>
                <strong>Group 5: Information Accessibility Challenges</strong><br/>
                Challenges in accessing information on non-profit websites are identified by interviewees. Overly complex application processes, scattered information, cluttered layouts, and lack of mobile-friendliness lead to frustration and discouragement. These challenges hinder their engagement and highlight the importance of user-friendly website design.<br/>
                <br/>
                <strong>Group 6: Enhancing Website Features</strong><br/>
                Enhanced website features, such as personalized dashboards, trip calendars, funding calculators, and collaboration portals, are highly valued by interviewees. These features streamline the process of finding and participating in educational opportunities, fostering greater interaction, and facilitating effective engagement with the organization's mission.
                </p>
                <p>
                <strong>Group 7: Transparency and Effective Communication</strong><br/>
                Transparency and effective communication are fundamental for building trust and connection with non-profit organizations. Interviewees across roles emphasize the importance of clear information about funding allocation, selection processes, and regular updates on funded trips. Transparent communication strengthens their commitment and motivates ongoing support.<br/>
                <br/>
                <strong>Group 8: Impact and Success Stories</strong><br/>
                Interviewees expect detailed and concrete impact reports that showcase the positive outcomes of funded trips. Stories, photos, and testimonials from beneficiaries contribute to trust-building. The ability to witness the organization's impact and success stories enhances their belief in the organization's mission and encourages continued involvement.<br/>
                <br/>
                <strong>Group 9: Personalized Content</strong><br/>
                Personalized content is seen as a potential improvement for non-profit websites. Interviewees express a desire for tailored recommendations based on individual needs, such as grade levels, interests, and collaboration types. Personalization has the potential to enhance engagement by delivering relevant information and opportunities.<br/>
                <br/>
                <strong>Group 10: Website Navigation and Layout</strong><br/>
                To retain engagement and support, non-profit websites should focus on featuring success stories, interactive elements, and consistent communication. Interviewees suggest strategies like showcasing testimonials, updating with inspiring stories, and offering practical resources. Regular updates and meaningful engagement efforts foster a sense of community and motivate ongoing participation.

              <p>As you explore non-profit organizations like M7 Education, which offer funding for educational school trips, you're driven by the desire to ensure that children have meaningful learning opportunities. However, the website's lack of clear and personalized information hampers your ability to engage and contribute effectively.

            <h3>Usability Testing - M7 Education</h3>
            <p>During our initial walkthrough of the website we came across a number of issues that we felt needed to be addressed in the redesign. <br/>
              5 usability tests were done, looking at the areas in which we felt were going to be most used when using the website for example:<br>
              - Finding the purpose of the organisation <br/>
              - Making a donation <br/>
              - Finding the most recent news <br/>
              - Finding the correct contact information.<br/>
              </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h3>Usability Testing M7 Education Findings</h3>
            <p><strong>Task 1 - Figuring Out What the Organisation Does:</strong><br/>
              - Majority of users struggled to quickly grasp the organisation's purpose from the homepage.<br>
              - Users commonly relied on the "About" page to understand the mission.<br/>
              - Adding a brief tagline or description on the homepage was suggested for immediate clarity.<br/>
              <br/>
              <strong>Task 2 - Making a Donation:</strong><br>
              - Most users easily located the "Donate" button on the homepage.<br/>
              - The donation process was perceived as lengthy and overwhelming by several users.<br/>
              - Suggestions included providing a "Quick Donate" option and simplifying the process steps. <br/>
              <br/>
              <strong>Task 3 - Finding the Most Recent Story/News:</strong><br/>
              - Users often identified the "Blog" section, though some questioned the label's connection to news.<br/>
              - Some users were unsure about the purpose of a bottom section redirecting to news.<br/>
              - Renaming "Blog" to "News & Updates" and providing clearer redirection indicators were recommended.<br/>
              <br/>
              <strong>Task 4 - Finding Contact Information:</strong><br/>
              - Users generally found the "Contact" section but encountered challenges with the presentation of contact details.<br/>
              - Email addresses at the bottom of forms were often difficult to distinguish due to their appearance.<br/>
              - Recommendations included using distinct colours, larger fonts, or altering the format for improved visibility.<br/>
